Fedora Atomic Nightly Build Scripts

This repository will be for scripts to build nightly/dev builds of [Fedora Atomic](https://getfedora.org/en/cloud/download/atomic.html)


## build-iso.sh

Dependencies: `mock`

NOTE: this script should be run as sudo and not as root because [mock](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Mock?rd=Subprojects/Mock) requires the ability to drop privs

This script will use mock on a Fedora or CentOS machine to build the Fedora Atomic ISO installer.

By default it will place the result in `/var/www/html/composes/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)` but that and effectively everything else about the script can be modified using the variables at the top of the script.

## build-pxetolive.sh

Dependencies: `mock`, `virt-install`,`lorax`

NOTE: this script should be run as sudo and not as root because [mock](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Mock?rd=Subprojects/Mock) requires the ability to drop privs

The script will take the installer iso created by `build-iso.sh`, kickstart from the git repository and create live Atomic Host images that can be booted with PXE.

First stage of build is creating raw disk image with livemedia-creator (using virt-install) on build host. This requires lorax, libvirt, virt-install, and qemu-kvm packages installed. Second stage - building live images from raw disk image with livemedia-creator is done in mock. The result should be placed into `/var/www/html/composes/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)` tree in `pxetolive` subdirectory.

## clean-isos.sh
Simple script to limit the number of historic composes to keep on disk. Defaults to 30, but is configurable. This should be run in rootâ€™s cron or in the cron of an user with sudo ALL
